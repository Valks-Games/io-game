## Contributing
#### Steps before creating a pull request.
1. Use `yarn lint` and `yarn lint:fix` to make sure your following the global linter rules.
2. Always test the application to see if it works as intended with no additional bugs you may be adding!
3. State all the changes you made in the PR, not everyone will understand what you've done!

#### New Concepts
Always consult the owner before introducing new concepts to the project.

#### Style
- Do not remove informative comments.
- Keep the indentation as is, do not expand something if it's compressed.
- Try to follow the general style the owner has laid down throughout all of the code.
